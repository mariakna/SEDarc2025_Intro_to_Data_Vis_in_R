# Introduction to Data Visualisation in R

This repository contains all materials used for the Introduction to Data Visualisation in R class, delivered as part of the SEDarc DTP on 19 November 2025.

This session provides an accessible introduction to data visualisation in R, covering both base R and *ggplot2*. We will start by creating the most common and useful types of plots using base R functions, and then show how to reproduce these plots with *ggplot2*, which is widely considered the gold standard for data visualisation in R. Throughout the class, we will discuss key principles for creating effective visualisations, including how to work with colour, what to emphasise, and what to avoid to ensure your plots are accurate and impactful. We will also cover creating multi-panel figures and exporting high-quality, publication-ready images. The session includes exercises that you can try after the class to reinforce your understanding of plotting in R. A Q&A session at the end will give you the opportunity to clarify any questions.

Most of the class content is based on the materials in the .html file (and its source .Rmd file). If you'd like to follow along or review the main topics covered in the session, start there. Note that two files, *ggplot_scheme.png* and *exporting_point_and_click.png*, are loaded when the .Rmd file is compiled. Make sure these files are available on your machine before knitting the Rmd file; otherwise, the document will not compile correctly. 

This repository also contains a slide deck (*Intro_to_Data_Vis_in_R_slides*) with visuals that we will use to explore the dos and don'ts of data visualisation.

Other files in the repository (such as .pdf and .png images) are either generated automatically when you run the .Rmd file on your own machine.
